# Shopping-Trends-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to clothing shopping trends. The dataset contains several columns including 'Customer ID', 'Age', 'Gender', 'Item Purchased', 'Category', 'Purchase Amount (USD)', 'Location', 'Size', 'Color', 'Season', 'Review Rating', 'Subscription Status', 'Shipping Type', 'Discount Applied', 'Promo Code Used', 'Previous Purchases', 'Payment Method', and 'Frequency of Purchases'.

The aim of this project is to gain insights and understand various aspects of clothing shopping trends using Python. The analysis includes the following insights:

1. Distribution of Purchase Amount:
This analysis provides an overview of the distribution of purchase amounts in the dataset. It helps understand the range of purchase amounts and identify any outliers or patterns.

2. Gender Comparison of Purchase Amount:
This analysis compares the purchase amounts between different genders. It aims to identify any significant differences in spending habits between male and female customers.

3. Category-wise Purchase Amount:
This analysis breaks down the purchase amounts by different categories of clothing items. It helps understand which categories are most popular and contribute the most to the overall sales.

4. Seasonal Purchase Trends:
This analysis explores the purchasing trends across different seasons. It provides insights into how customer preferences change with seasons and helps identify any seasonal patterns or trends.

5. Ratings Distribution:
This analysis examines the distribution of review ratings given by customers. It helps evaluate the overall satisfaction level of customers and identify any trends or patterns in the ratings.

6. Subscription Status Distribution:
This analysis analyzes the distribution of customers based on their subscription status. It helps understand the proportion of subscribed and non-subscribed customers and their purchasing behavior.

7. Payment Method Distribution:
This analysis investigates the distribution of payment methods used by customers. It helps identify the most commonly used payment methods and analyze any preferences or trends related to payment methods.

8. Statistical Summary by Gender:
This analysis provides a statistical summary of various variables in the dataset, segmented by gender. It helps compare the characteristics and behaviors of male and female customers.

9. Statistical Comparison of Purchase Amount by Category:
This analysis compares the purchase amounts across different categories of clothing items. It helps identify any significant differences in spending patterns between categories.

10. Correlation between Purchase Amount and Review Rating:
This analysis explores the correlation between purchase amount and review ratings. It helps determine if there is any relationship between the amount spent and the satisfaction level of customers.

The Python code used to perform these analyses can be found in the project's repository. The code utilizes popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
